# Custom QMK firmware keymap for Keeb.io Sinc Rev4

This is my custom QMK keymap for my Keeb.io Sinc split 75% keyboard. I removed the macro keys on the left hand side and added an encoder to the right side. 

My board is rev4, so this keymap only works with rev4. I compile the firmware by changing to the sinc/rev4 and then `qmk compiile -kb pneisen`
